# Taxi_Aggregator_Case_Study
This project is the Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on New York City's yellow taxi market. The challenge is provided by Fast Cars, a cab agglomerator like Uber and Ola. They are going to launch their product in New York City. We are tasked to understand the new york taxi market before their product launch.

I have taken following steps in this project to complete the EDA:

Dropped unnececssary columns
Added new columns that could add value
Extensive cleaning of data i.e removing Nans and bogus data
Univariate Ananlysis of Continuous and Categorical variables
Bivariate Analysis between important variables that could lead us to new insights.
Provided in-depth analysis of data
Recommended solutions which can be beneficial to the organization
